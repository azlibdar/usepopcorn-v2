# usePopcorn v2 üçø

Welcome to the usePopcorn project! This is a movie search application built with React JS, designed to provide a hands-on learning experience for React beginners. It's a perfect starter project if you're just beginning your journey with React and want to get familiar with concepts like `useState`, `useEffect`, and component composition.

## About the Project üî†

usePopcorn allows users to search for movies, view details, and keep track of their watch history. It utilizes the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to fetch movie data. The project aims to showcase the fundamental React concepts in a practical and engaging way.

This project was originally inspired by the [usePopcorn](https://usepopcorn.netlify.app/) site, but with additional features and improvements made by me to enhance the learning experience.
